```

### Protocol Detection
- **SMB/SMB2/SMB3**: Signing requirements, channel binding, version detection *(no auth required)*
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: EPA/CBT enforcement *(Auth required for reliable HTTPS checks)*
- **LDAP/LDAPS**: Signing requirements, channel binding *(Auth required for reliable CBT check on LDAPS)*
- **MSSQL**: EPA enforcement *(Auth required for reliable check)*
- **RPC**: MS-RPC endpoint enumeration, authentication requirements *(Auth required for reliable check)*
- **WINRM/WINRMS**: WS-Management, EPA enforcement, channel binding *(Authed check)* (**WIP**)
- **SMTP**: NTLM authentication detection, STARTTLS support (**WIP**)
- **IMAP/IMAPS**: NTLM authentication, encrypted mail access (**WIP**)

### Advanced Detection
- **NTLM Reflection**: Identifies hosts vulnerable to NTLM reflection attacks (CVE-2025-33073)
- **CVE-2025-54918**: Detects unpatched Windows Server 2025 hosts vulnerable to NTLM reflection via PrintSpooler RPC coercion to LDAPS. Reported as MEDIUM on any unpatched Server 2025 host; escalates to CRITICAL when the host is a DC with PrintSpooler enabled. Checked via UBR (Update Build Revision) queried from the registry.
- **CVE-2019-1040 (Drop the MIC)**: Detects hosts with UBRs below the June 2019 patch threshold, enabling MIC field stripping for cross-protocol relay (SMB to LDAP/LDAPS) with ntlmrelayx's `--remove-mic`. Reported as HIGH. Uses the UBR already queried per-host, no additional network requests.
- **Ghost SPN Detection**: In `--audit` mode, queries Active Directory for Service Principal Names whose hostnames have no DNS record. An attacker can register the missing DNS name to intercept NTLM authentication intended for that service principal. Findings are split into *vulnerable* (no DNS record at all) and *probably vulnerable* (resolves only via wildcard DNS). Reported as MEDIUM. Full findings written to `possible-ghost-spns.txt`. Suppress with `--no-ghosts`.
- **WebDAV/WebClient**: Detects hosts with the WebDAV WebClient service running
- **NTLMv1 Support**: Checks for NTLMv1 authentication support (individually or at GPO level)
- **Coercion Vulnerabilities**: Detects unauthenticated (if specified) PetitPotam, PrinterBug, DFSCoerce

### Relay Path Analysis
- Automatically identifies viable relay attack paths (Functioning, needs more work)
- Prioritizes paths by impact (critical, high, medium, low)
- Cross-protocol relay detection (requires `--ntlmv1` or `--ntlmv1-all` - cross-protocol detection only when confirmed Net-NTLMv1 usage discovered)
- NTLM reflection paths (including partial MIC removal paths/cross-protocol relay)
- CVE-2025-54918 paths: MEDIUM on any unpatched Server 2025 host, CRITICAL on unpatched DC with PrintSpooler enabled
- CVE-2019-1040 paths: HIGH, SMB-to-LDAP cross-protocol relay via MIC stripping (`--remove-mic`)
- Ghost SPN paths: MEDIUM, up to 5 shown in the report with full output in `possible-ghost-spns.txt`
- Severity rating logic is WIP, submit PRs for upgrades/improvements! Not 100% of situations/scenarios are accounted for currently - the goal is to cover all possible primitives.

###  Targeting Options
- **Active Directory Audit `(--audit)`**: Enumerate all computers from AD via LDAP. Requires low-priv AD credentials and *functional DNS* within environment. Force with `--dc-ip` or edit `/etc/resolv.conf`. 
- **File Input**: Load targets from text file
- **CIDR Notation**: Scan entire subnets (e.g., `10.0.0.0/24`)
- **IP Ranges**: Scan IP ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.1-254`)
- **Individual Hosts**: Target specific hosts or FQDNs (`python3 relayking.py -u blah -p pass -d domain.local <your_target_ip_or_hostname>`)

### Output Formats
- **Plaintext**: Human-readable output with detailed findings
- **JSON**: Structured data for programmatic analysis
- **XML**: Hierarchical data format
- **CSV**: Spreadsheet-compatible format
- **Grep-able**: One-line-per-result format for easy parsing
- **Markdown**: Documentation-ready format

### Misc Features
- **Mass Coercion**: `--coerce-all` combined with `--audit` and low-priv creds to coerce EVERY domain machine for mass computer account relaying. Highly useful in environments with Net-NTLMv1 enabled.
- **Net-NTLMv1 Discovery**: `--ntlmv1` or `--ntlmv1-all` to detect LanMan GPOs at domain level. `--ntlmv1-all` checks ALL hosts from AD and their registry values using RemoteRegistry. **(requires local admin)**.
- **Relay List Generation**: `--gen-relay-list <file>` to produce a readily-importable target file for ntlmrelayx.py's `-tf` switch.
- **Ghost SPN Check**: Automatically runs in `--audit` mode when credentials are present. Suppress with `--no-ghosts`. Full findings are written to `possible-ghost-spns.txt` alongside the main report; the report itself shows the first 5 to avoid clutter.
- **Flexible Kerberos Auth Features**: Kerberos auth via -k (and a FQDN for `--dc-ip`) should work pretty nicely. If the environment has domain controllers that have NTLM disabled entirely but tolerate it everywhere else, you can use `--krb-dc-only` so it doesn't mess with any checks. Also, --dns-tcp and -ns are available for work conducted over SOCKS/other proxy pivots. Even kerb works in this scenario pretty easily.

## Usage
#### Print command line args/usage with `-h`, as expected:
```
python3 relayking.py -h
```

###  Examples

#### Recommended Usage Flags for Full-Network Coverage + Output Scan Report to Plaintext & JSON:
```bash
python3 relayking.py -u ‘lowpriv’ -p ‘lowpriv-password’ -d client.domain.local --dc-ip 10.0.0.1 -vv --audit --protocols smb,ldap,ldaps,mssql,http,https --threads 10 -o plaintext,json --output-file relayking-scan --proto-portscan --ntlmv1 --gen-relay-list relaytargets.txt
```
#### Lighter Authenticated Scan w/ No HTTP(S) Checks + Output Scan Report to Plaintext & JSON:
```bash
python3 relayking.py -u ‘lowpriv’ -p ‘lowpriv-password’ -d client.domain.local --dc-ip 10.0.0.1 -vv --audit --protocols smb,ldap,ldaps,mssql -o plaintext,json --output-file relayking-scan --proto-portscan --gen-relay-list relaytargets.txt
```
#### Single-Target Auth'd Scan (single-target = positional, final arg) + Report ONLY to stdout in plaintext:
```bash
python3 relayking.py -u ‘lowpriv’ -p ‘lowpriv-password’ -d client.domain.local -vv --protocols smb,ldap,ldaps,mssql,http,https -o plaintext SERVER1-EXAMPLE.LAB.LOCAL
```
#### Unauth Sweep with CIDR Range As Target + No Report File/stdout as plaintext only:
```bash
python3 relayking.py --null-auth -vv --protocols smb,ldap,http -o plaintext 10.0.0.0/24
```
#### Full Audit, Check ALL Hosts for Net-NTLMv1 via RemoteRegistry (HEAVY):
```bash
python3 relayking.py -u ‘lowpriv’ -p ‘lowpriv-password’ -d client.domain.local --dc-ip 10.0.0.1 -vv --audit --protocols smb,ldap,ldaps,mssql,http,https --threads 10 -o plaintext,json --output-file relayking-scan --proto-portscan --ntlmv1-all --gen-relay-list relaytargets.txt
```
## Functionality notes:
### Performance
* There’s 10 main scanner threads/jobs by default, specified with `--threads`. Each main thread gets worker threads for certain tasks under it. HTTP, for example, uses 20 threads per main thread. This results in ~200 HTTP threads open to scan for HTTP NTLM auth. Most of the time, this is tolerated substantially well but if it causes lag/network issues, reduce the threads. The default of 10 threads is exceptionally quick anyways.
* You probably pretty much always want to use `--proto-portscan` with all your scans. It significantly improves performance and prevents the scanner from waiting for timeouts on ports that aren't actually there. If it causes issues, you can remove at the expensive of scan performance (but it shouldn't!)
### Grouping
* Scan can be conducted with grouping by dividing hosts into groups. Options `--max-scangroup`, `--split-into` and `--skip` can be used to control grouping.
- You can specify `--max-scangroup` to specify the number of targets for each group. For example, `--max-scangroup 100` will split 299 targets into 3 groups. Groups will have targets as 100, 100 and 99.
- You can specify `--split-into` to specify the number of groups. For example, `--split-into 3` will split 299 targets into 3 groups. Groups will have targets as 100, 100 and 99. You cannot specify both `--max-scangroup` and `--split-into` in same time.
- You can specify `--skip` to skip groups. For example, `--max-scangroup 3 --skip 1` will split 299 targets into 3 groups as 100, 100 and 99 targets, and skip the first group then starts scanning from second group. It helps when you would like to restart this tool.
### Feature Behavior Notes:
* `--ntlmv1` or `-ntlmv1-all`: Adding `--ntlmv1` will pull every LanMan GPO for the domain and nothing else. Requires low-priv AD creds. `--ntlmv1-all` requires admin credentials and will check **every individual host in the domain** with SMB open for the LMCompatibilityLevel registry key. Running at least `--ntlmv1` **is required to show/detect cross-protocol SMB relay paths**.
	* Remote registry being disabled can cause jank with `--ntlmv1-all`. Also very heavy and not OPSEC safe, but thorough. Probably not recommended unless you’re YOLO’ing or desperate.
* **Output in various formats**. Supplying formats in comma-separated notation (`-o json,plaintext`) and `--output-file relayking-scan` produces relayking-scan.json + relayking-scan.txt so there’s no need to run it twice for multiple formats. Available: `plaintext, json, xml, csv, grep, markdown` (**default: plaintext)**
* `--coerce-all` functionality will use PetitPotam, DFSCoerce, and PrinterBug on ALL HOSTS TARGETED. It also mass-coerces every machine in the domain without running the full protocol audit. Supplying `--audit` + `--coerce` at the **same time** will perform a domain audit **AND** mass-coercion. (**HEAVY**)
* **Ghost SPN** (`--audit` mode only): After the host scan completes, RelayKing queries AD for SPNs whose hostnames have no DNS record. These are candidates for DNS registration attacks that intercept NTLM authentication. The report includes up to 5 findings to keep output manageable; the full list is always written to `possible-ghost-spns.txt` in the working directory. Pass `--no-ghosts` to skip this check entirely.
* **CVE-2025-54918**: Checked via the UBR (Update Build Revision) already read from each host’s registry during the scan. Unpatched Server 2025 hosts (build 26100, UBR < 6584) report MEDIUM. If the host is also a DC with PrintSpooler enabled, severity escalates to CRITICAL.
* **CVE-2019-1040 (Drop the MIC)**: Also UBR-driven, no extra network traffic. Hosts below the June 2019 patch threshold are flagged HIGH and identified as candidates for cross-protocol relay with ntlmrelayx’s `--remove-mic` flag.

## To-Do

* Lot more testing (YOU CAN HELP)
* Shell file coercion dropper + cleanup. (Needs specific features - reach out directly if you want to add this)
* Create usage wiki
* Kerberos relaying + paths. Create logic surrounding all krb relay techniques including reflection.
* Potential `--opsec-safe` mode that avoids Impacket/other fingerprinted Python library usage. Not trivial to implement.

## KNOWN ISSUES

* With multiple side-tools and features doing their own querying of LDAPS, this has created absolutely INSANE logic in terms of not having them consolidated and each doing their own thing. Right now I believe that --ntlmv1, the cred validator, the ghost SPN module, AND the target analyzer all each do their own thing for auth. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS and needs to be consolidated to use one single module for auth.
* Probably additional dumb quirks with various combinations of LDAP signing and channel binding.
* Serious badness with RPC on the latest Server 2025 / Win11 builds. Needs fixing.
* Dumb edge cases with HTTP(S) services that are hard to account for giving false positive/negative results.

## Submitting Issues/Pull Requests
### Issues
* Issues opened containing errors/tool failures without any details ("this doesn't work"/"why no work") will be closed.
* Generally speaking, run the tool with `-vv` or `-vvv` if you're experiencing errors. Logging continues to improve with each version.
* When submitting issues, as much detail as possible is highly desirable so debugging/troubleshooting is possible. Please redact any sensitive info from debugging output such as client/target domains, machine names, any other sensitive info. You don't want to leak your client's relay skeletons to the world.
* Usage args that produced issues/errors/broken behavior are also necessary.
* Issues that arise from user-error or broken, misconfigured environments will be reviewed, and likely closed. **Exceptions** to this are situations where the tool **SHOULD** gracefully handle an environment-specific quirk and it fails to run/throws exceptions+stack traces when encountered. These situations should be fairly obvious. Examples of user error/busted network setup below:
	* For example, you run `--audit` and RelayKing fails to resolve any hosts in DNS because their DNS server(s) just refuse to resolve their computer FQDNs in the target DNS zone. Not a RelayKing issue. 
	* Or, for example, failing to ensure DNS is configured properly on your testing host (by validating /etc/resolv.conf) and then stuff fails to resolve properly - not a RelayKing issue.
    * Anything else PEBKAC.
### Pull Requests:
* PRs always welcome. New features, improvements, and refactors that improve performance/overall logic are desirable. 
* Feature requests can be submitted via PRs. Description of the feature, specific behavior, and potential usage flags/args are generally be the minimum needed to consider implementation.
* PRs should be thoroughly tested, ideally in multiple environments before being submitted. We'll test PRs before merging them, but the more testing in unique environments (especially after major changes/refactoring) = the better. I want to keep RelayKing reliable, robust, and high-performance - which mandates extensive testing.

**Consider the behavior & nature of ALL tools you run for a client engagement and on their network(s). This is accomplished by reading tool source and understanding the inner-workings prior to execution, not by blindly executing code you found on GitHub. While I can assure you that there's no deliberately malicious/destructive code inside of RelayKing, validating all novel/unused tools prior to running them is generally speaking, good practice. Trust, but always verify.**

**Be careful using on red team exercises, especially with authenticated checks and `--audit`. You WILL get detected and it will be your fault! You should have read the warning at the top of the README if you somehow are reading this sentence and didn't know this already.**
